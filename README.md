# Learning Synergies
Learning Multiple Synergies for the Same Motor Task.

The code allows to reproduce the results presented in the paper:

F. Tessari,A.M. West,& N. Hogan,  Explaining human motor coordination via the synergy expansion hypothesis, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122 (13) e2501705122, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2501705122 (2025).

The repo contains 3 files, 1 Matlab script and 2 Matlab functions:
- PNAS_tessari_2025.m --> This is the key script. Run this to reproduce the paper results.
- DIEM_stat.m and getDIEM.m --> These functions are required to correctly run the PNAS_tessari_2025.m script.

JFYI, the DIEM_stat.m and getDIEM.m functions are also available at this GitHub dedicated repo: https://github.com/ftessari23/DIEM
